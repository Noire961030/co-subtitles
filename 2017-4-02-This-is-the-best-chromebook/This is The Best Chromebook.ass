Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.16,0:02:36.75,Default,,0,0,0,,chances are if your favorite app isn't

Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.11,0:03:04.70,Default,,0,0,0,,the App Store selection is huge, so yeah I think
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.70,0:03:06.20,Default,,0,0,0,,that's just the state of Chromebooks
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.20,0:03:08.16,Default,,0,0,0,,right now. So I want to talk about the
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.16,0:03:10.35,Default,,0,0,0,,device in specific now. So this is the
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.35,0:03:13.70,Default,,0,0,0,,ASUS C302 and personally I think this
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.70,0:03:15.87,Default,,0,0,0,,is the best Chromebook right now; it's
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.87,0:03:17.70,Default,,0,0,0,,expensive - it's five hundred dollars, and
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.70,0:03:19.59,Default,,0,0,0,,I guess let's talk about the things that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.59,0:03:21.90,Default,,0,0,0,,I do like about first. So it's got great
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.90,0:03:23.70,Default,,0,0,0,,build quality; full aluminum build,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.70,0:03:25.83,Default,,0,0,0,,everything is solid - there's no plastic

Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.23,0:03:29.04,Default,,0,0,0,,to the finish feels like a top tier device.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.04,0:03:31.05,Default,,0,0,0,,There is like you can see over
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.05,0:03:32.82,Default,,0,0,0,,here that it wasn't milled from a single
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.82,0:03:34.29,Default,,0,0,0,,block of aluminum there's like two
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.29,0:03:36.03,Default,,0,0,0,,pieces that they put together, but the
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.03,0:03:37.38,Default,,0,0,0,,build quality on this thing is quite
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.38,0:03:39.87,Default,,0,0,0,,good. There's two USB-C ports and there's
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.87,0:03:42.12,Default,,0,0,0,,no USB-A ports - obviously not a huge
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.12,0:03:43.79,Default,,0,0,0,,selection of ports, but it's a Chromebook
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.79,0:03:45.54,Default,,0,0,0,,and you probably won't be connecting too
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.54,0:03:47.34,Default,,0,0,0,,many devices to this thing. You also have
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.34,0:03:49.01,Default,,0,0,0,,your microSD slot and then on the other
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.01,0:03:51.09,Default,,0,0,0,,side you have your volume rocker, power
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.09,0:03:54.69,Default,,0,0,0,,button and audio jack. The screen is

Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.42,0:03:59.22,Default,,0,0,0,,accurate, I'd say it's about average for
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.22,0:04:01.70,Default,,0,0,0,,a higher end laptop or Chromebook. There
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.70,0:04:03.54,Default,,0,0,0,,are better screens out there but I like
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.54,0:04:05.58,Default,,0,0,0,,this one a lot. Performance is pretty
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.58,0:04:07.62,Default,,0,0,0,,strong - strong enough I mean for what you
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.62,0:04:09.20,Default,,0,0,0,,would do on a Chromebook - I can easily
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.20,0:04:11.91,Default,,0,0,0,,have 10 chrome tabs open with Spotify,

Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.08,0:04:26.64,Default,,0,0,0,,I would highly recommend getting the

Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.78,0:05:09.49,Default,,0,0,0,,there's another competitor to this that
